Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall is a linear approach where each phase (planning, design, development, testing, deployment) is completed before moving to the next.
Advantages:Clear structure and documentation.                 Disadvantages:Less flexibility for changes.
           Easier to estimate time and cost.                                Late testing can lead to costly fixes.           
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile Works Best For:Changing Requirements – If the project needs frequent updates.
